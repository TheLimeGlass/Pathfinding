//Settable is similar to @Multiple but in the sense that you can modify which classes the user can be allowed to set this expression too.
//@Settable({Player[].class, Entity[].class})
//This will allow users to add/set/remove/delete players and entities from your expression.
//So now you just need to handle the incoming delta array which could contain players and entities.
