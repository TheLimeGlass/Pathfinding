# Pathfinding API
A Spigot Minecraft pathfinding API with Skript support.

This projet is still in development. Information will be provided when the complete API has been finished.

Grabbing the API

```
Pathfinding.getPathfindingAPI();

or if running as a bukkit plugin.

Pathfinding pathfinding = (Pathfinding)Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("Pathfinding");
pathfinding.getPathfindingAPI();
```

There will be a dedicated API probably using gradle when the API has been finished.
